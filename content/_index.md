Hi, I'm Raffael.

Systems that keep working when reality shows up.

This site is my workshop — where I write about platform automation, edge infrastructure, applied security, and open standards. Languages and AI are tools; they serve humans, not the other way around.

When I wander off, it is usually into tooling and DevEx, or a stack I think is simply good. This is a low-noise corner of the internet. Take what's useful.
