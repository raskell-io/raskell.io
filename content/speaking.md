### [Self-Learning WAF: Using Generative AI to Tame ModSecurity False Positives — NCS-W01](https://path.rsaconference.com/flow/rsac/us26/FullAgenda/page/catalog/session/1753946922633001YdMq)

**RSAC 2026** · Wednesday, March 25, 2026 · 8:30–9:20 AM PDT (16:30–17:20 CET)

ModSecurity with the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) is a powerful open-source WAF, but tuning false positives remains painful and time-consuming. This session introduces a self-learning approach that uses generative AI to analyze blocked requests, determine legitimacy, and automatically generate tuning rules — reducing manual effort while keeping humans in the loop for approval.

**Key takeaways:**
- How generative AI can classify WAF false positives with high accuracy
- A practical pipeline for automated rule generation with human oversight
- Lessons learned from applying this approach in production environments

**Media-friendly version:** Using generative AI to automatically detect and fix WAF false positives — keeping ModSecurity effective without the tuning headache.
